    <p>For Assignment 1, We had to design a phonestand, so i decided to go with a levitating phone holder which looks cool.</p>
    <p>I decided to sketch the phonestand form the side of it and extrude it sideways, this way it will be easier to make as i can make the curves/fillets easily</p></div>

        <p>For the Second Assignment, we had to make a accessory box which makes it really difficult as we could not use glue to combine parts. However,
            there is many different ways to make different parts combine together using wood. I choose to go with press fitting as it was satisfying yet complex.

        <p>The third assignment, four circuits are needed to be made by us and for the first circuit, i made a circuit which
            will cause the LED light to blink in a certain sequence such as once then twice.

    <div class="text4">
        <p>For the second task, we are told to make a code that make three LED lights to blink in sequence which are 
            red,green then blue. This code took quite a long time to do but i managed to do it with the help of some videos

    <div class="text5">
        <p>The third task was the most challenging one then the other task. We are supposed to add on a push button to the first circuit which already has a randomize blinking pattern
            pressing the button will turn the LED on and pressing it again will turn it off but i really could not figure this one out.

    </div>

    <div class="text5">
        <p>This last circuit was rather more straightforward as it was more in a sequence as when pushing the button, it will light up the 
            red LED followed by the green then the blue and finally it will light them all up and pushed 1 more time to off.
            The coding used in this circuits was easier to understand as C++ was a language we learnt however, the LED commands was a new concept 
            that i didn't know about
