      <p>The original idea was to make a automated plant box which will alarm you if there is not even water in the soil.</p>
      <p>so this is basically how the plant box is suppose to work and how big it was suppose to be.</p></div>

    <p>This was the final sketch for the plant box, it shows the different features
      such as the holes on the sides to let the buzzer sound through,
      </p>
      <div class="rails">
        <img src="rails of final.png" alt="front"></a>
    </div>
    <p>The cool feature is this rails that i made that allows the lit to pass throught easily.
      Although i planned to 3D print the whole thing and laser cut some of the circles,
      the printing time would take way too long so i decided to laser cut most
      of the walls instead and for the decoration and the rails i would 3D print it.

        </div>
        <p>I had to use thinkercad to test out my circuit, however, thinkercad does not seem to have 
          the exact DHT11 humidity/moisture sensor that i have in real life. I had to do more research
          and managed to find the code and necessary codes to make the actual sensor work or else any other
          codes will not work for this circuit. I tried to uploud various codes and libraries to the board but
          it still would not work until i realised that i needed to add a certain lib function to intiate the 
          code. Here is the actual code that i uplouded to the arduino board which allowed it to work.
          This means that the buzzer will activate and buzz if the humidity falls below 90%
          and pressing the button will delay the buzzing for 30 seconds unless moisture is presented meaning that
          the humidity will be more that 90%.

        </div>

      <p>After using laser cutting to cut out my walls and joining them together using the finger joints,
        i used 3D printing to print out two rails that allows the lid to smoothly slide in and out making it easily
        accessible to the circuit if something is faulty.

        In this video i will show you how my lil planter works and how to use it properly.
