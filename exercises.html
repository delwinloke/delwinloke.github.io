        <p>The first exercise is designing a mug in fusion 360. There are many ways to make a mug but 
            they taught use to use the revolve function to make the little arc at the bottom of the mug.

        <p>The second exercise is a pretty simple one, we have to make a logo using Inkscape which is currently what is on my website
            i felt that making a complex logo will be too much so i decided that my initials will suffice.

            For the third exercise, we were getting used to the different functions that fusion 360 has some of this consists of the arc, circles and different constaints

            This lego brick was our 5th exercise and was a little more fun as we got to learn how to make the shape of
            the lego brick but as well as extrude it to a certain height using the extrude function.
            we also made use of the mirror function to replicate the little circles on the brick to make it 
            more convienent.

            for our 6th exercise, we had to design a nametag in fusion 360, i decided to just go
            with a simple desgin with a little depth to it and made my name 3D looking.
